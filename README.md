# crispy-goggles
A plug-and-play, hardware info module for [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) that makes your status bar smarter, fancier, and (let's be honest) more impressive than your neighbor's. Get CPU, RAM, GPU, and disk stats in real time, with a tooltip that even your cat will want to click.
